The purpose of the exercice is to extend the App with an alternative login method, using user's lastname and registration number to authenticate.
The registration number is a 5 to 8 digits number which is not yet available in the app model
TODO:

- [ ] Add registration number field in user model (and update test data with some sample registration numbers to be able to test)
- [ ] Add needed backend endpoint to login using lastname and registration number
- [ ] Add a link at the bottom of the login form to switch to the alternative login method
